## Section 1 - What is Machine Learning

### Lecture 2 - Solving Machine Learning Problems

* ML can do predicions based on historical data. e.g if it rain 240mm what the flood damage will there be
* The ML Problem Solving Process
	* Identify data that is relevant to the problem
	* Assemble a set of data related to the problem we're trying to solve
	* Decide on the type of output we are predicting
	* Based on type of output, pick an algorithm that will determine a correlations between our 'features' and 'labels'
	* Use model generated by algorithm to make a prediction
* For our example problem 'annual rainfall' is the feature or independent variable. Flood damage costs is the dependent variable 'label'
* in this course we will see how we can collect data format it and prepare it for ML
* we will assume we have no data. data can come from videos, newspapers, websites
* flood repair spending can come from budget reports. 
* all is assembled in a table

### Lecture 3 - A Complete Walkthrough

* Value of Labels are discrete set? Classification
* Value of Labes is continuous? Regression
* the example problem about floods is a regression problem (we predict money)
* Some takeaway points
	* Features are categories of data points that affect the value of labels
	* Datasets almost always need cleanup and formatting
	* Regression for continuous vals, Classification for diescrete
	* Many many different ML algorithms exist each with pros and cons anf or different type of problems.
	* models relate the value of features to the value of labels

### Lecture 4 - App Setup

* we go to [Github Starter Projects](https://github.com/StephenGrider/MLKits) and download them in our course workspace
* we go to '/MLKits/plinko'
* we open 'index.html'

### Lecture 5 - Problem Outline

* what we see is a game that puts (randomly?) disks in buckets increasing their counter.
* we will use it to build a dataset trying to predict in which bucket the ball will end to given the drop point

### Lecture 6 - Identifying Relevant Data

* apart from the priamry feature (drop position) we identify 2 minor features. ball size and bonciness. both are randonly selected between a configurable range of values

### Lecture 7 - Dataset Structures

* the app offers a lot of ways to record our tries and collect data (dataset)
* In JS datasets can be:
	* Arrays of objects eg `[{dropPosition: 300, bonciness: 0.4, ballSize: 16, bucket: 4}]`
	* Nested Arrays [[300,0,4,16,4],[350,0.4,35,5],[416,0.4,16,4]]. Indices are Important
* we open 'score.js'. it has 2 method signatures one to collect the data set and one to run the analyzsis to predict

### Lecture 8 - Recording Observation Data

* we flesh out 'onScoreUpdate' a callback  called everytime a round ends to collect data
```
const outputs = [];

function onScoreUpdate(dropPosition, bounciness, size, bucketLabel) {
  // Ran every time a balls drops into a bucket
  outputs.push([dropPosition,bounciness,size,bucketLabel]);
  console.log(outputs);
}
```
* we test and see an evergroing nested array

### Lecture 9 - What Type of Problem?

* our problem is clearly a Classification
* our classification algorithm of choice is K-Nearest Neighbor (knn) is based on clustering

## Section 2 - Algorithm Overview

### Lecture 10 - How K-Nearest Neighbor Works
